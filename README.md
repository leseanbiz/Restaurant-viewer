To run project:
Open terminal
use 'git clone {url}' to clone from GitHub repo
Run 'yarn install' to get all dependencies
Navigate to the root directory of the repo 'cd your-location/adpearence-restaurants'
Run 'node server.js' to start the server to provide the supplied data
In a new terminal tab, run 'yarn start' to launch the front-end of the application

Project notes:
bootstrapped with create-react-app.
Material-UI for layout and components
Redux for state management combined with minimal hooks
Redux-saga for data fetching
Node.js and ExpressJS use to establish server to provide the supplied data

Current Issues:
amount of filters change when selecting an option

Future work:
Find a better solution for data filtering
Move data merging to back-end
Cleaner grid alignment
Put interactive UI pieces in left side drawer
Use custom icons in card avatar instead of 'type' initial
Append 'https://' to URLs that are missing it
More efficient use of Material-UI theming
